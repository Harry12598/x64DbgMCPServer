# X64Dbg MCP Server Plugin

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server plugin for [x64dbg](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg) that enables AI-assisted reverse engineering. Built with C# on .NET Framework—no ASP.NET Core required.

This plugin creates a lightweight HTTP bridge between MCP clients and the x64dbg debugger, allowing LLM-powered tools to interactively inspect memory, disassemble code, query registers, manipulate labels/comments, and more—all remotely and programmatically.

## Features

- ✅ Self-hosted HTTP server (no ASP.NET Core dependency)
- ✅ Lightweight, zero-dependency deployment
- ✅ Modular command system with parameter mapping
- ✅ Direct access to registers, memory, threads, and disassembly
- ✅ Bidirectional AI/LLM command support
- ✅ Hot-reload plugins without restarting x64dbg
- ✅ Expression function and menu extension support

### Installing the Plugin

1. **Rename the output file:**
   - Locate `x64DbgMCPServer.dll` in `x64DbgMCPServer\bin\x64\Debug`
   - Rename it to `x64DbgMCPServer.dp64` (or `.dp32` for 32-bit)

2. **Copy to x64dbg plugins folder:**
   - Create the folder if it doesn't exist: `x64dbg\release\x64\plugins\x64DbgMCPServer`
   - Copy all files from `bin\x64\Debug` to this folder

## Troubleshooting

### "Access is denied" when starting MCP server

If you see `Failed to start MCP server: Access is denied` in the x64dbg logs (Alt+L), Windows requires special permissions to listen on HTTP URLs.

**Option 1: Run as Administrator (Quick fix)**
- Right-click `x64dbg.exe` → **Run as administrator**

**Option 2: Grant URL permissions (Recommended)**

Run these commands in an elevated PowerShell or Command Prompt:
```cmd
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:50300/sse/ user=Everyone
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:50300/message/ user=Everyone
```

After running these commands, x64dbg can be started normally.

### Plugin fails to load / x64dbg crashes on startup

Ensure downloaded DLLs are not blocked by Windows:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "path\to\plugins" -Recurse | Unblock-File
```

Blocked files prevent .NET Framework from loading assemblies for security reasons.

---

## Development

### Debugging Setup

The `DotNetPlugin.Impl` project includes post-build commands for rapid iteration. Update the paths to match your x64dbg installation:

```
xcopy /Y /I "$(TargetDir)*.*" "C:\path\to\x64dbg\plugins\x64DbgMCPServer"
C:\path\to\x64dbg\x64dbg.exe
```

This automatically copies the plugin and launches x64dbg after each build.

### Project Structure

- **DotNetPlugin.Stub** — Native entry point for x64dbg
- **DotNetPlugin.Impl** — Main plugin implementation
- **DotNetPlugin.RemotingHelper** — Assembly remoting support

---

## How It Works

The MCP server runs an `HttpListener` that routes incoming requests to C# methods marked with the `[Command]` attribute. These methods can perform any operation (memory reads, disassembly, breakpoints, etc.) and return structured data to MCP clients.

```
MCP Client  →  HTTP Request  →  HttpListener  →  [Command] Method  →  x64dbg API
     ↑                                                                      |
     └──────────────────────  JSON Response  ←──────────────────────────────┘
```

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `ExecuteDebuggerCommand` always returns `true` (indicates command was dispatched, not result) | Fix implemented, needs verification |
| Default configuration listens on all IPs (`+`), requiring admin privileges | See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for workarounds |
| Some commands are not fully implemented | Active development |

## Acknowledgments

⚡ Built with the help of [DotNetPluginCS](https://github.com/mrexodia/DotNetPluginCS) by Adams85.

This project represents ~20 hours of focused development, MCP protocol review, and iteration to create a self-contained HTTP MCP server plugin for x64dbg—no Kestrel, no ASP.NET, just raw `HttpListener` powering reverse engineering automation.
